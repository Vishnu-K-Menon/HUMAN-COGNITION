# HUMAN-COGNITION
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for analyzing EEG data during transcranial direct current stimulation. It leverages phase transfer entropy. A metric derived from phase entropyâ€”to quantify functional connectivity between brain regions. These features were extracted from raw EEG data using Brainstorm. The code then applies various machine learning models (with options for Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVR, XGBoost, and MLP) to predict a target variable of interest. Hyperparameter tuning is performed via randomized search with cross-validation. Finally, the model is interpreted using SHAP values and feature importance plots to identify the most influential connectivity features.
